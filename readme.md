## Features
- **Early Disease Detection**: Classifies plant diseases with high accuracy for proactive crop management.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design to facilitate easy interaction for users.
- **Scalable Model**: Designed for efficiency, suitable for real-world applications in agriculture.

## Architecture
The architecture of the Crop Watch system includes:

- **Image Processing**: Images are resized to 128x128 pixels and converted into arrays suitable for CNN input.
- **Convolutional Neural Network**: The model consists of multiple Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers for feature extraction, alongside Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
- **Training Phase**: 
  - Utilizes the Adam optimizer with a learning rate set for efficient training.
  - Trains over 10 epochs with a batch size of 32, minimizing error between predicted and actual outputs.
  - Employs a softmax layer for converting raw outputs into class probabilities.
- **Performance Analysis**: The model is assessed using a test set to evaluate its generalization capabilities on unseen data.
